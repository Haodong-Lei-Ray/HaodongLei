<!-- 我的教育背景 -->
### Education
2024 - Present: [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/)  
- Master of Engineering, [School of Software](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), [PALM Laboratory](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/intro.html)  

2020 - 2024: [Hainan University (HNU)](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/)  
- Bachelor of Engineering, [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.hainanu.edu.cn/)

### Current Research
#### Speculative Sampling (2024/9 ~ Present)
I am currently focusing on Speculative Sampling, a novel technique designed to accelerate the decoding process in large language models. This method leverages a smaller, faster draft model to generate multiple tokens simultaneously, which are then verified and refined by a larger target model in a single pass. By aligning the output distribution with that of the target model, Speculative Sampling significantly improves computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, making it a promising approach for optimizing real-time AI applications, such as natural language generation.

### Research Experience
During 2024, I conducted research on AI Agents, exploring how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to create systems capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution. This experience ignited my interest in AI and its practical applications. Currently, as a Master’s student, I am focusing on Speculative Sampling, a cutting-edge technique aimed at enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models, particularly in large language models. My work at the PALM Laboratory allows me to contribute to innovative solutions in pattern learning and data mining.
